In addition to temperature/salinity measurements, Biogeochemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) profiling floats are capable of autonomously observing at highfrequency bio-optical properties such as the chlorophyll fluorescence, a proxy of the chlorophyll a concentration (Chla), the particulate backscattering coefficient (bbp), a proxy of the stock of particulate organic carbon, and the light available for photosynthesis. We analyzed an unprecedented BGC-Argo database of morethan 8,500 multivariable profiles collected in various oceanic conditions, from subpolar waters to subtropicalgyres. Our objective is to refine previously established Chla versus bbp relationships and gain insights intothe sources of vertical, seasonal, and regional variability in this relationship. Despite some regional, seasonaland vertical variations, a general covariation occurs at a global scale. We distinguish two main contrastedsituations: (1) concomitant changes in Chla and bbp that correspond to actual variations in phytoplanktonbiomass, e.g., in subpolar regimes; (2) a decoupling between the two variables attributed to photoacclimation or changes in the relative abundance of nonalgal particles, e.g., in subtropical regimes. The variability inthe bbp:Chla ratio in the surface layer appears to be essentially influenced by the type of particles and byphotoacclimation processes. The large BGC-Argo database helps identifying the spatial and temporal scalesat which this ratio is predominantly driven by one or the other of these two factors.1. IntroductionOur ability to observe the dynamics of phytoplankton biomass and associated carbon fluxes on relevantspace and time scales considerably limits our understanding and prediction skills of the biogeochemical roleof phytoplankton in the carbon biological pump (Honjo et al., 2014; Legendre et al., 2015; Volk & Hoffert,1985). For example, in situ measurements of primary production and phytoplankton carbon biomass are particularly challenging and remain scarce, although novel promising techniques have been recently proposed(Graff et al., 2012, 2015; Riser & Johnson, 2008). To overcome space-time coverage sampling limitations, biooptical oceanographers have implemented optical sensors on a variety of in situ or remote platforms, fromresearch vessels and moorings to ocean color satellites, gliders, and profiling floats, each with specific complementary space-time observation scales (Claustre et al., 2010; Dickey, 2003). Such platforms enable to monitor bio-optical properties that serve as proxies for major biogeochemical variables. Those include theconcentration of chlorophyll a (Chla) and the particulate backscattering coefficient at 700 nm (hereafterreferred simply as bbp). The chlorophyll a concentration is the most commonly used proxy for the phytoplankton carbon biomass (Cullen, 1982; Siegel et al., 2013), although it is well known that the ratio of Chla tocarbon shows large fluctuations driven by a variety of factors such as phytoplankton physiology (Alvarezet al., 2016; Geider, 1993; Staehr et al., 2002) or community composition (Geider et al., 1997; Halsey & Jones,2015; MacIntyre et al., 2002). In the absence of mineral particles (i.e., in most open ocean waters), bbp generally covaries with, and is therefore used as a proxy of, the stock of particulate organic carbon (POC; Bishop,Key Points: The bbp-to-Chla relationship variesalong the water column, as well aswith seasons and oceanic regions The bbp-to-Chla ratio is a valuablebiogeochemical proxy for assessingthe nature of the particulateassemblage and revealingphotoacclimation processes The BGC-Argo float network yields anunprecedented amount of qualitydata for studying biogeochemicalprocesses at a global scale and alongthe vertical dimensionSupporting Information: Supporting Information S1 Supporting Information S2 Supporting Information S3 Table S1 Table S2 Table S3Correspondence to:M.

American Geophysical Union.All Rights Reserved.Journal of Geophysical Research: OceansPUBLICATIONS=== [PAGE 2] ===2009; Loisel et al., 2002; Stramski et al., 1999). However, changes in the nature (composition and size) ofthe particle assemblage may cause large variability in the bbp signal and in the POC-to-bbp relationship(Bishop, 2009; Flory et al., 2004; Gardner et al., 2006; Stramski et al., 2008).Examining bio-optical relationships, which, for example, link the inherent optical properties of particles suchas absorption or scattering, to Chla, has long been an area of active research in bio-optical oceanography(Bricaud et al., 1995; Huot & Antoine, 2016; Mitchell, 1992; Mitchell & Holm-Hansen, 1991; Morel et al., 2007;Organelli et al., 2017a; Smith & Baker, 1978a; Szeto et al., 2011). Among different types of applications, biooptical relationships enable deriving biogeochemical information over a broad range of space and timescales from in situ or remote optical measurements (Huot et al., 2007; Loisel et al., 2002; Siegel et al., 2005).Such relationships are also used in semianalytical inverse models to interpret remote sensing ocean colordata (Gordon et al., 1988; Loisel & Morel, 1998; Morel & Maritorena, 2001). Various studies focused on therelationship between Chla and bbp using data from ocean color remote sensing (Reynolds et al., 2001;Stramska et al., 2003), field cruises (Dall’Olmo et al., 2009; Huot et al., 2008), fixed mooring (Antoine et al.,2011), or Biogeochemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) profiling floats (Xing et al., 2014). All of these studies confirmedthe principle of the ‘‘bio-optical assumption’’ (Siegel et al., 2005; Smith & Baker, 1978b), suggesting that inopen ocean waters the optical properties of a water mass covary to a first order with Chla. Yet dependingon the considered data set, previous studies also indicate large second-order variability around the meanbbp versus Chla power law relationship (Brown et al., 2008; Huot et al., 2008; Xing et al., 2014). Restricted toa given period of time, region, or trophic regime and mainly to the surface layer of the water column, thesestudies did not lead to a thorough characterization of the variability in the relationship between Chla andbbp over the full range of environments encountered in the open ocean. In addition, these studies involveddifferent methodologies for bbp measurements or retrievals, so that it is difficult to untangle regional and/orseasonal variability from possible methodological biases (Sullivan et al., 2013).The recently launched network of BGC-Argo profiling floats is progressively transforming our capability toobserve optical properties and biogeochemical processes in the oceans (Biogeochemical-Argo PlanningGroup, 2016; Claustre et al., 2010; IOCCG, 2011; Johnson & Claustre, 2016). The current BGC-Argo bio-opticaldatabase has drastically increased over recent years and now encompasses observations collected in a broadrange of hydrological, trophic, and bio-optical conditions encountered in the world’s open oceans (Organelliet al., 2017a, 2017b). Based on homogeneous measurements and processing methodologies, this databaseoffers a unique opportunity to comprehensively reassess bio-optical relationships. Based on the analysis ofmore than 8,500 multivariable profiles collected within the water column (0–1,000 m) by BGC-Argo floats,this study aims to (i) investigate the natural variability around the mean statistical bbp-to-Chla relationship atthe vertical, regional, and seasonal scales and (ii) identify the underlying sources of variability.2. Data and Methods2.1. BGC-Argo Profiling Floats2.1.1. BGC-Argo DatabaseAn array of 105 BGC-Argo profiling floats was deployed in several areas of the world’s oceans in the frameof several research programs (Organelli et al., 2016a, 2017a). BGC-Argo profiling float real-time data areaccessible online (at ftp://ftp.ifremer.fr/ifremer/argo/dac/coriolis/), distributed as netCDF data files (Wonget al., 2013), and updated daily with new profiles. The quality-controlled database of bio-optical vertical profiles that supports this work is publicly available from SEANOE (SEA scieNtific Open data Edition) publisher(Barbieux et al., 2017). In this database, profiles of bbp were eliminated when bathymetry was shallowerthan 400 m and a signature of bbp at depth was noticeable. This allowed us to remove the data collected inwaters where a coastal influence was suspected, Black Sea excepted. Hence, 8908 BGC-Argo multiparameterprofiles or ‘‘stations’’ (corresponding to 91 different BGC-floats) collected between 8 November 2012 and 5January 2016 were used in this study. These stations were grouped into 24 geographic areas (Table 1), following the bioregions presented in Organelli et al. (2017a), except for the Eastern Subtropical Atlantic Gyrethat is missing in our database because of suspicious backscattering data from the two profiling floatsdeployed in this bioregion.Our database includes measurements from a wide range of oceanic conditions, from subpolar to tropicalwaters and from eutrophic to oligotrophic conditions (Figure 1). For the purpose of simplifying theJournal of Geophysical Research: Oceans10.1002/2017JC013030=== [PAGE 3] ===presentation of the results, we grouped the different bioregions into five main regimes: (1) the North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre (NSPG) divided in Icelandic Basin, Labrador and Irminger Seas; (2) the Southern Ocean(SO) essentially comprising the Indian and the Atlantic sectors; (3) the Mediterranean Sea (MED) that comprises the Northwestern Basin (NW_MED), the Southwestern Basin (SW_MED), the Tyrrhenian Sea(TYR_MED), the Ionian Sea (ION_MED), and the Levantine Sea (LEV_MED); (4) the subtropical regimes (STG)that include subtropical oligotrophic waters from the North and South Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and RedSea (RED_SEA); and (5) the Black Sea (Table 1).2.1.2. Biogeochemical-Argo Sensor Characteristics and Sampling StrategyThe ‘‘PROVOR CTS-4’’ (NKE Marine Electronics Inc., France) is a profiling autonomous platform specificallydesigned in the context of the Remotely Sensed Biogeochemical Cycles in the Ocean (remOcean) and NovelArgo Ocean Observing System (NAOS) projects. The PROVOR CTS-4 profiling floats used in this study wereequipped with a SBE 41 CTD (Seabird Inc., USA), an OCR-504 (SAtlantic Inc., USA) multispectral radiometermeasuring the Photosynthetically Available Radiation over the 400–700 nm range (PAR), and an ECO3(Combined Three Channel Sensors; WET Labs, Inc., USA) measuring the fluorescence of chlorophyll a andColored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) at excitation/emission wavelengths of 470/695 and 370/460 nmrespectively, and the angular scattering coefficient of particles (b(h, k)) measured at 700 nm and an angle of1248. Measurements were collected during upward casts programmed every 1, 2, 3, 5, or 10 days dependingon the mission and scientific objectives. All casts started from the parking depth at 1,000 m at a time thatwas sufficient for surfacing around local noon. Vertical resolution of acquisition was 10 m between 1,000and 250 m, 1 m between 250 and 10 m, and 0.2 m between 10 m and the surface. Raw data (electroniccounts) were transmitted to land, each time the floats surfaced, through Iridium two-way communication,and were converted into desired quantities. Each variable was quality-controlled according to proceduresdescribed hereafter and specifically developed for BGC-Argo data (Organelli et al., 2016b; Schmechtig et al.,Table 1Bioregions With the Corresponding Abbreviation, Regime, and Number of Available Floats and Profiles Represented in theBGC-Argo Database Used in the Present Study.LocationRegion abbreviationRegimeN8 profilesN8 floatsNorwegian SeaNOR_ARCNorth Subpolar Gyre (NSPG)Icelandic BasinICB_NASPGIrminger SeaIRM_NASPGLabrador SeaLAS_NASPGSouth Labrador SeaSLAS_NASPGNorth Atlantic Transition Zone to northernborder of the Subtropical GyreSTZ_NASPGAtlantic to Indian Southern OceanATOI_SOSouthern Ocean (SO)Indian Sector of the Southern OceanIND_SOAtlantic Sector of the Southern OceanATL_SOLigurian Sea and Gulf of LionsNW_MEDMediterranean Sea (MED)Provencal and Algero-Provencal BasinSW_MEDTyrrhenian SeaTYR_MEDIonian SeaION_MEDLevantine SeaLEV_MEDRed SeaRED_SEASubtropical Gyre (STG)North Atlantic Western Subtropical GyreWNASTGSouth Atlantic South Subtropical GyreSSASTGNorth Atlantic Subtropical GyreNASTGSouth Pacific Subtropical GyreSPSTGNew Caledonia sector of the PacificNC_PACSouth Atlantic Subtropical GyreSASTGSouth Atlantic Subtropical Transition ZoneSASTZNorth Atlantic Transition Zone toSubtropical Equatorial AtlanticEQNASTZBlack SeaBLACK_SEATOTALJournal of Geophysical Research: Oceans10.1002/2017JC013030=== [PAGE 4] ===2014, 2016). Additionally, all the casts were checked for data degradation due to biofouling or instrumentaldrift.2.2. Bio-Optical Data Processing2.2.1. Chlorophyll a ConcentrationAfter dark counts have been subtracted from the raw signal, chlorophyll a fluorescence was first convertedinto chlorophyll a concentration according to calibration coefficients provided by the manufacturer (WETLabs, 2016). Following the procedures described in Schmechtig et al. (2014), the real-time dedicated qualitycontrol procedure identified the occurrence of negative spikes, adjusted chlorophyll a concentration profiles for cases of nonzero values at depth and verified the range of measured values according to technicalspecifications provided by the manufacturer (WET Labs, 2016). In order to correct for the effect of the socalled nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ; decrease in the fluorescence-to-Chl a ratio under high light conditions; Kiefer et al., 1973), we systematically applied the procedure developed by Xing et al. (2012). Besides,in some bioregions such as subtropical gyres or the Black Sea, the chlorophyll a concentration appeared toincrease at depth where it should be null. Proctor and Roesler (2010) assigned this behavior to the influenceof fluorescence originating from nonalgal matter. Profiles were thus corrected according to Xing et al.(2016). Finally, following the recommendation by Roesler et al. (2017) for Chla measurements from WETLabs ECO fluorometers, the calibrated quality-controlled Chla values were divided by a correction factor of 2.The correction factor was deducted from a global comparison of paired HPLC (high-performance liquidchromatography) and in situ fluorescence Chla data and confirmed by optical proxies of Chla such as lightabsorption line height (Roesler & Barnard, 2013) or in situ radiometry (Xing et al., 2011). The regional variability of this average correction factor along with its possible uncertainties is fully discussed in Roesleret al. (2017). We performed a sensitivity analysis of the bbp-to-Chla relationship to the factor used for correcting the fluorescence-based Chla values. We tested the influence of using two sets of regional factorsproposed by Roesler et al. (2017) derived either from HPLC analyses or radiometric measurements, compared to the global factor of 2. Except for the Southern Ocean that appears more sensitive than otherregions to the choice of the correction factor, our analysis reveals that the regional factors induce minorchanges to the bbp-to-Chla relationship. Overall, those minor changes have little impact on theFigure 1. Geographical location of the multivariable vertical profiles collected by the BGC-Argo profiling floats representedin the database used in this study. The geographic locations are superimposed on an annual climatology of the surface chlorophyll a concentration derived from MODIS-Aqua climatological observations for the year 2015 (https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi/l3).Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans10.1002/2017JC013030=== [PAGE 5] ===interpretation of our results. Thereafter our analysis considers Chla values originating from the global correction factor. Details of the sensitivity analysis may be found in electronic supporting information A.2.2.2. Particulate Backscattering CoefficientWe followed the procedure established by Schmechtig et al. (2016). Backscattering sensors implementedon floats provide the angular scattering coefficient b at 1248 and at 700 nm. The particulate backscatteringcoefficient was calculated following Boss and Pegau (2001):bbpð700Þ ðm21Þ5vð124Þ32p3fbð124; 700Þ–bswð124; 700Þg(1)with b(124,700) (m21 sr21) 5 slope 3 (counts – bbdark)where the (instrument-specific) slope and bbdark are provided by the manufacturer, and v(124) is equal to1.076 (Sullivan et al., 2013). The contribution of pure seawater (bsw) was removed and computed accordingto Zhang et al. (2009). Finally, vertical profiles were quality-controlled by verifying the range of measuredvalues according to the technical specifications provided by the manufacturer (WET Labs, 2016) and removing negative spikes following Briggs et al. (2011). Remaining spikes were removed by applying a median filter (five-point window).2.2.3. Estimation of Uncertainty in the bbp-to-Chla RatioThe backscattering and chlorophyll fluorescence sensors implemented on floats are all ECO3 sensors (WETLabs, Inc.). This avoids heterogeneous sources of uncertainties associated with various sensors (see e.g., Roesler et al., 2017). In addition, the data are calibrated and qualified following the recommended standard BGCArgo procedure presented in Schmechtig et al. (2016). A thorough estimation of the uncertainties affectingthe different parameters would necessitate an entirely dedicated study, which is beyond the scope of the present one. However, an estimation of the average error that may influence our results has been made.Accounting for measurement error only, we assume an error r bbp 700ðÞ m21ðÞ 5 2:2 3 1026 for the bbp sensor and r Chl a mg m23ðÞ 5 0:007 for the chlorophyll fluorescence sensor, as provided by the manufacturer. Following an error propagation law (Birge, 1939; Ku, 1966), the combined effect of these errors on thebbp-to-Chla ratio can be computed and a relative error (in %) can be obtained asr bbp=ChlaffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffirbbpChla2 1 bbp23 rChla2Chla42 3 bbp 3cor bbp;ChlaðÞ3 rbbp 3 rChlaChla33Chlabbpvuut(2)With cor (bbp, Chla) corresponding to the correlation between the particulate backscattering coefficient andthe chlorophyll a. Considering the surface data, a median error of 0.11% is obtained and 80% of the datashow relative errors lower than 10% (Figure 2a). Relative errors larger than 10% appear for the lowest valuesof bbp (<1023 m21) and Chla (<1022 mg m23; Figure 2b), which corresponds to the clearest waters of theoligotrophic gyres. In addition, a sensitivity analysis described in supporting information A indicates thatcorrecting the fluorescence-based Chla values of the database with regional factors compared to a globalfactor does not significantly affect the distribution of the computed errors in the bbp-to-Chla ratio.2.3. Derived Variables2.3.1. Physical and Biogeochemical Layers of the Water ColumnWe consider four different layers of the water column: (i) the productive layer (Morel & Berthon, 1989) comprised between the surface and 1.5 Zeu, with Zeu corresponding to the euphotic depth which is the depth atwhich PAR is reduced to 1% of its surface value; (ii) the mixed layer where all properties are expected to behomogenous and that encompasses a large fraction of the phytoplankton biomass (Brainerd & Gregg, 1995;Taylor & Ferrari, 2010); (iii) the surface layer, observable by satellite remote sensing, extending from surfaceto the first optical depth (Zpd; Gordon & McCluney, 1975); and (iv) the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM)layer (i.e., thickness of the DCM) where different processes may lead to a Chla enhancement. Unlike the productive layer, the surface, the mixed and the deep chlorophyll maximum layers are considered as homogeneous layers where the phytoplankton population is expected to be acclimated to the same light andnutrient regimes. The 0–1.5Zeu layer is chosen to estimate the average bbp-to-Chla ratio in the entireenlightened layer of the water column, even if it is acknowledged that large variations in this ratio mayoccur throughout this layer. This average bbp-to-Chla ratio is thereafter used as a reference to which wecompare the ratios calculated for the other layers of the water column.Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans10.1002/2017JC013030=== [PAGE 6] ===The mixed layer depth (MLD) was determined using a 0.03 kg m23 density criterion (de Boyer Montegut,2004). The euphotic depth Zeu and the penetration depth, Zpd 5 Zeu/4.6, were computed from the BGCArgo PAR vertical profiles following the procedure described in Organelli et al. (2016b). Values of Zeu andZpd are available from Organelli et al. (2016a). To study more specifically the dynamics of the bio-opticalproperties in the DCM layer and because the width of a DCM may fluctuate in space and time, weadjusted a Gaussian profile to each vertical profile of Chla of the database that presented a deep Chlamaximum and computed the width of this DCM. This parameterizing approach proposed by Lewis et al.(1983) has been widely used to fit vertical profiles of Chla (e.g., Morel & Berthon, 1989; Uitz et al., 2006)such asc zð Þ5cmaxe2z2zmaxDzðÞ(3)where c(z) is the Chla concentration at depth z, cmax is the Chla concentration at the depth of the DCM(zmax), and Dz, the unknown, is the width of the DCM.In order to retrieve Dz, the unknown parameter, we performed an optimization of equation (3) with a maximum width set at 50 m so only the profiles with a relatively pronounced DCM are kept. Then we computedthe mean Chla and bbp for the layer that represents the thickness of the DCM.Figure 2. Boxplot of the distribution, for each of the 24 bioregions represented in the BGC-Argo database used in this study, of the (a) chlorophyll a concentration(Chla) in the surface (0-Zpd) layer, (b) particulate backscattering coefficient at 700 nm (bbp) in the surface (0-Zpd) layer, (c) depth of the euphotic layer (Zeu), and(d) mixed layer depth (MLD). Note that the bioregions are ordered following the absolute value of the latitude and, within the Mediterranean Sea, following thelongitude (i.e., from west to east). Red points beyond the end of the whiskers represent outliers beyond the 1.5 3 IQR (IQR 5 interquartile range) threshold.Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans10.1002/2017JC013030=== [PAGE 7] ===Finally, all quality-controlled profiles of Chla and particulate backscattering coefficient were averaged withinthe different considered layers.2.3.2. Environmental and Biological ParametersIn order to analyze the variability in the bbp-to-Chla relationship, we consider the role of the light conditions in the various layers of the water column, i.e., the productive, mixed, surface, and DCM layers. Thevertical profiles of bbp:Chla and PAR were averaged within each of the four considered layers. For eachlayer and both variables, the median value was computed monthly and regionally (i.e., for each regime).For each layer and each regime, we determined the maximum observed PAR that was used to normalizethe monthly median PAR values of the corresponding layer and regime (PARnorm). Ultimately, for eachlayer and each regime, the monthly median PARnorm values were classified into four different intervals (0–0.25; 0.25–0.50; 0.50–0.75; 0.75–1), and the monthly averaged bbp: Chla values were assigned to one ofthese four PARnorm intervals.Using the method of Uitz et al. (2006), an index of the phytoplankton community composition, based onthe relative contributions of size classes to total chlorophyll a, was also computed from the surface Chla values. We applied this procedure to the surface Chla values from our BGC-Argo database that we furthermonthly averaged to finally obtain the relative contributions of microphytoplankton to the total chlorophylla biomass for each bioregion within the 0-Zpd layer.3. Results3.1. Overview of the BGC-Argo DatabaseA latitudinal decreasing gradient of surface Chla is observed from the North Subpolar Gyre (NSPG) andSouthern Ocean (SO) regimes to the subtropical (STG) regime with a median Chla from 1 mg m23 to0.05 mg m23, respectively (Figure 2a). It is noteworthy that, in our data set where the South East PacificOcean is not represented, the South Atlantic Subtropical Gyre (SASTG) is the most oligotrophic bioregion,experiencing the lowest median Chla (0.014 mg m23) and the highest median Zeu (135 m). A west-to-easttrophic gradient is observed in the Mediterranean Sea, with median surface Chla values of 0.186 and 0.025mg m23 in the Northwestern Basin and the Levantine Sea, respectively (Figure 2a).A similar pattern is observed in the surface particulate backscattering coefficient values (Figure 2b). Mediansurface bbp values range between 0.002 m21 in NSPG and 0.0003 m21 in STG regime. In the Mediterranean Sea, the bbp values vary over 1 order of magnitude, with maximum values found in the NorthwesternBasin and minimum values in the Levantine Sea. The North Atlantic Transition Zone to Subtropical Equatorial Atlantic (EQNASTZ) bioregion exhibits particularly high values of bbp compared to other STG regions(Figure 2a). The Zeu values also show a latitudinal gradient (Figure 2c), with median values of 50 m inNSPG and 125 m in STG regimes. The median MLD shows a significant variability among the 24 bioregions(Figure 2d). The distribution of the MLD in the Mediterranean Sea is centered on a low median value of23 m, but very large values (>250 m) are episodically observed in the Northwestern Mediterranean(NW_MED). The deepest mixed layers (median value of 98 m) are observed in the South Labrador Sea(SLAS_NASPG), and episodes of extremely deep mixed layers (1,000 m) are also recorded in the LabradorSea (LAS_NASPG). The shallowest mixed layers are observed in the Black Sea (20 m). It is also worth tonotice that MLD values in STG are particularly stable and feature very few outliers.3.2. Variability in the bbp-to-Chla Relationship at the Global ScaleWithin Distinct Layers of the Water Column3.2.1. The Productive LayerIn this layer, the bbp-to-Chla relationship follows a power law (R2 5 0.74; Figure 3a). Yet when data from different regimes and bioregions are considered separately, regional and seasonal patterns emerge. Bioregionsof the subpolar NSPG and SO regimes (Figures 4a–4i) show a significant correlation between Chla and bbpwith high R2 (>0.60) and slope (i.e., exponent of the power law) always above 0.50 (except for the Norwegian Sea, Figure 4a). Minimal values of both Chla and bbp are encountered in winter whereas maximal values are reached in summer. Deviations from the global log-log linear model occur in some bioregions ofthe NSPG regime, e.g., in the Icelandic Basin (ICB_NASPG) in summer (Figure 4b) and are characterized byan abnormally high bbp signal considering the observed Chla levels. Such a deviation is found all year longin the Black Sea, where a correlation between Chla and bbp is no longer observable (R2 5 0.09; Figure 4x).Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans10.1002/2017JC013030=== [PAGE 8] ===In the Mediterranean Sea, the slope and R2 decrease from the Northwestern Basin (NW_MED, Figure 4j) tothe Levantine Sea (LEV_MED, Figure 4n), where Chla appears to be decoupled from bbp. In the Mediterranean Sea, a seasonal pattern is noticeable principally in the NW_MED, where the highest values of Chla andbbp are found in spring. Except for the South Atlantic Subtropical Transition Zone (SASTZ) that displays asteep slope and a high R2 value (0.68 and 0.80, respectively), regions from the subtropical regime do notshow any significant correlation between Chla and bbp, featuring the lowest slope and R2 values of the bbpto-Chla relationship (Figures 4o–4w). This clearly suggests a decoupling between those two properties. Inthese oligotrophic environments, different production regimes are delineated along the vertical axis in theupper and lower part of the euphotic zone. One may expect that the bbp-to-Chla relationship will varydepending on the considered layer. In this perspective, we further investigate the behavior of the biooptical properties in different layers of the water column, namely the mixed layer, the surface layer, and theDCM layer.3.2.2. The Mixed and Surface LayersThe distribution of Chla and bbp data for the surface and mixed layers shows similar patterns (Figures 3band 3c). The distribution in the surface layer shows two distinct trends. With the exception of the Atlantic toIndian Southern Ocean (ATOI_SO) bioregion that shows an important dispersion of bbp values during summer, the data collected in the NSPG and SO regimes and NW_MED bioregions exhibit a clear log-log linearcovariation between Chla and bbp associated with slopes above 0.3 and high R2 (Figures 5a–5j), similarly towhat is observed for the productive layer (Figures 3a and 4). In the subpolar NSPG and SO regimes, valuesof bbp and Chla in the 0-Zpd layer reach their maximal values in summer (Figures 5a–5i), whereas in theNW_MED, the highest values are recorded in spring (Figure 5j). Data from the subtropical regime (STG) forma separate cluster where Chla and bbp are decoupled, with generally very low R2 values. Chla valuesFigure 3.

The Eastern Mediterranean basin does not feature any spring maximum in Chla and bbp (Figures5m and 5n). However, there is a noticeable winter increase in Chla as reported also in the STG regime.Regarding the Black Sea bioregion, high values of both variables are observed and no seasonal pattern isnoticed (Figure 5x), consistent with what is observed in the productive layer.Figure 4.

The Deep Chlorophyll Maximum LayerThe analysis of the bbp-to-Chla relationship at the level of the DCM obviously considers only the seasonal orpermanent stratified regimes (and bioregions) where a DCM occurs, i.e., the Mediterranean and subtropicalregimes. The bbp-to-Chla relationship in the DCM layer gradually deviates from the relationship establishedin the productive layer considering all bioregions (Figure 3d). Chla is systematically higher by a factor 2Figure 5.

For Chla > 0.3 mg m23, a positive correlation between bbp andChla can be noticed, although with a large dispersion of the data around the regression line, whereas forChla < 0.3 mg m23, Chla and bbp exhibit a strong decoupling. The MED Sea (Figures B1a–B1e in electronicsupporting information B) is characterized by a stronger covariation between Chla and bbp than the STGregime (Figures B1f–B1n in electronic supporting information B) (R2 5 0.53 for NW_MED versus R2 5 0.10 forSPSTG). In the Mediterranean Sea, DCMs are seasonal phenomena occurring essentially in summer or fall(e.g., Siokou-Frangou et al., 2010). A covariation between bbp and Chla occurs as soon as a DCM takes place,with maximum values of bbp and Chla encountered in summer when the DCM is the most pronounced, inboth the western and eastern Mediterranean basins. On the opposite, in the STG regime where durablestratification takes place, DCMs appear as a permanent pattern. The bbp and Chla variations are decoupledand the highest values of both variables are recorded in spring or fall.4. DiscussionThe present analysis of a global BGC-Argo database indicates a general power relationship between bbpand Chla in the productive layer as well as in the surface and mixed layers. Nevertheless, the analysis of subsets of data suggests a large second-order variability around the global mean relationships, depending onthe considered range of values in Chla and bbp, layer of the water column, region, or season. In this section,we investigate the sources of variability around the average bbp-to-Chla relationship in our database.4.1. General Relationship Between Chla and bbpThe chlorophyll a concentration is the most commonly used proxy for the phytoplankton carbon biomass(Cullen, 1982; Siegel et al., 2013), whereas the particulate backscattering coefficient is considered as a proxyof the POC in open ocean (Balch et al., 2001; Cetinic ́ et al., 2012; Dall’Olmo & Mork, 2014; Stramski et al.,1999) and provides information on the whole pool of particles, not specifically on phototrophic organisms.Over broad biomass gradients, the stock of POC covaries with phytoplankton biomass and hence bbp andChla show substantial covariation. This is what is observed in the present study when the full database isconsidered (Figure 3a). This is also the case when we examine subsets of data from the NSPG and SOregimes that feature strong seasonality and show relatively constant relationships between bbp and Chla(Figures 3a–3c, 4a–4I, and 5a–5i). In such environments, an increase in the concentration of chlorophyll a isassociated with an increase in bbp. Such significant relationships between bbp and Chla have indeed beenreported in several studies based on relatively large data sets (Huot et al., 2008) or measurements fromseasonally dynamic systems (Antoine et al., 2011; Stramska et al., 2003; Xing et al., 2014). Our resultscorroborate these studies and yield a global relationship of the form bbp(700) 5 0.00181 (60.000001)Chla0.605 (60.005) for the productive layer.Nevertheless, the bbp-to-Chla relationship is largely variable depending on the considered layer of the watercolumn. Regarding the mixed and surface layers, our study suggests a general relationship with determination coefficients smaller than those calculated for the productive layer. The intercept (0.0017) and moreimportantly the slope values (0.36) associated with the surface layer are also lower than those associatedwith the productive layer (Table 3); hence, for a given level of bbp, the Chla is lower for the surface layerthan predicted by the productive layer relationship. Empirical relationships of the literature previouslyestablished in various regions in the first few meters of the water column (Antoine et al., 2011; Dall’Olmoet al., 2009; Reynolds et al., 2001; Xing et al., 2014) always show steeper slope compared to our results forthe surface layer (Table 2).To our knowledge, the present study proposes the first analysis of the bbp-to-Chla relationship within theDCM layer. A significant relationship between bbp and Chla is observed and it is associated with the steepest slope, the highest RMSE and the lowest coefficient of determination in comparison with the other layers(Table 3). Thus, for the DCM layer, a given level of bbp is associated with higher values of Chla than predicted by the global relationship of the productive layer.Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans10.1002/2017JC013030=== [PAGE 12] ===In the next two sections, we will investigate the underlying processes leading to the existence or not of arelationship between bbp and Chla and explore the variability of this relationship along the vertical dimension, the seasons and the distinct bioregions of the different regimes. For this purpose, we will consider thebehavior of the bbp:Chla ratio with respect to light conditions and phytoplankton community composition.4.2. Influence of the Nature of the Particulate Assemblage on the bbp-to-Chla RelationshipAlthough the relationship between POC and bbp is evident in some regions, the particulate backscatteringcoefficient is not a direct proxy of POC. It depends on several parameters such as the concentration of particles in the water column, their size distribution, shape, structure, and refractive index (Babin & Morel,2003; Huot et al., 2007; Morel & Bricaud, 1986; Whitmire et al., 2010). The bbp coefficient has been shown tobe very sensitive to the presence of picophytoplankton as well as of nonalgal particles of the submicronsize range (e.g., detritus, bacteria, and viruses), especially in oligotrophic waters (Ahn et al., 1992; Stramskiet al., 2001; Vaillancourt et al., 2004), but also to particles up to 10 mm (Loisel et al., 2007).In regions with substantial inputs of mineral particles, a shift toward enhanced bbp values for a constantChla level occurs (Figures 4w and 4x, 5w and 5x). Substantial concentrations of mineral particles, submicrometer particles of Saharan origin, for example, have been shown to cause significant increases in the particulate backscattering signal (Claustre et al., 2002; Loisel et al., 2011; Prospero, 1996; Stramski et al., 2004).The EQNASTZ bioregion exhibits, for example, particularly high bbp values compared to the low Chla foundin the surface layer (Figures 4w and 5w). This is not surprising considering that this region is located in theEquatorial North Atlantic dust belt (Kaufman et al., 2005). The Black Sea is also characterized by a higher bbpsignal than predicted from Chla based on our global model (Figures 4x and 5x). This could be explained bythe fact that this enclosed sea follows a coastal trophic regime and is strongly influenced by river runoffthat may carry small and highly refractive lithogenic particles (Ludwig et al., 2009; Tanhua et al., 2013). Suchan increase in backscattering signal may also be related to coccolithophorid blooms (Balch et al., 1996a).These small calcifying microalgae highly backscatter light due to their calcium carbonate shell and theirpresence could explain the episodically higher bbp than predicted by the global regression modelTable 2Empirical Relationship Between the Particulate Backscattering Coefficient (bbp) and the Concentration Of Chlorophyll a (Chl a) Previously Published in the LiteratureWith the Corresponding Reference and Abbreviation, Region, and Layer of the Water Column Considered for AnalysisEmpirical relationshipRegionLayer in thewater columnAbbreviationReferencebbp(k) 5 0.0023 – 0.000005(k – 550) Chla0.565 1 0.000486(k–550)Eastern South Pacific2/Kd(490)H08Huot et al.

Indeed, inopen ocean waters, phytoplankton generally dominate the pool of particles in the water column. A shifttoward higher or weaker bbp values at a constant Chla level may be explained by changes in the phytoplankton community composition. However, in oligotrophic environments, nonalgal particles may representa significant part of the particulate assemblage (Loisel et al., 2007; Stramski et al., 2004; Yentsch & Phinney,1989). Indeed, a background of submicronic living biological cells such as viruses and bacteria or even nonliving particles including detritus or inorganic particles could influence the bbp:Chla ratio (e.g., Claustreet al., 1999; Morel & Ahn, 1991; Stramski et al., 2001).The lowest bbp:Chla values in our global database occur in summer in the NSPG and SO regimes (Figures6a–6i) and are associated with large contributions (>40%) of microphytoplankton to the total Chla. Thisactually corroborates the hypothesis of Cetinic ́ et al. (2012, 2015) that bbp:Chla can be considered as an optical index of the phytoplankton community composition. High values of the bbp:Chla ratio are associatedwith large contributions of picophytoplankton and nanophytoplankton to algal biomass and low valueswith diatom-dominated communities. The occurrence of microphytoplankton blooms of large-sizedFigure 6. Monthly climatology of the bbp:Chla ratio within the surface layer (0-Zpd). The color code indicates the fractionalcontribution of the microphytoplankton to the chlorophyll biomass associated with the entire phytoplankton assemblage,estimated from the Uitz et al. (2006) parameterization. In each figure, the horizontal black line shows the minimum valueof the bbp:Chla ratio determined within each bioregion. The black lines represent the standard deviation for each datapoint.Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans10.1002/2017JC013030=== [PAGE 14] ===phytoplankton community is indeed well known in the NSPG regime (Barton et al., 2015; Cetinic ́ et al., 2015;Li, 2002) or in some productive regions of the Southern Ocean (Georges et al., 2014; Mendes et al., 2015;Uitz et al., 2009). Similarly, in the NW_MED bioregion, low bbp:Chla values are accompanied by large contributions of microphytoplankton during the spring bloom (Marty & Chiaverini, 2010; Mayot et al., 2016;Siokou-Frangou et al., 2010). On the opposite, high bbp:Chla values in summer are rather associated withdominant contributions of the picophytoplankton and nanophytoplankton to the total chlorophyll biomass(Figure 6j) and also possibly to a higher proportion of nonalgal particles, consistently with Navarro et al.(2014) or Sammartino et al. (2015).In the rest of the Mediterranean Basin (SW_MED, TYR_MED and the Eastern Basin) (Figures 6k–6n) as well asin the subtropical regime, the phytoplankton biomass is essentially constant throughout the year with highbbp:Chla values in summer, lower values in winter, and a relatively constant picoplankton-dominated algalcommunity (Figures 6o–6w; Dandonneau et al., 2004; Ras et al., 2008; Uitz et al., 2006). In this region, theseasonal cycle of the bbp:Chla ratio does not seem to be influenced at a first order by changes in phytoplankton community composition.4.3. Influence of Photoacclimation on the bbp-to-Chla RelationshipThe Chla is an imperfect proxy of phytoplankton biomass that varies not only with phytoplankton carbonbiomass but also with environmental conditions such as light, temperature, or nutrient availability (Babinet al., 1996; Cleveland et al., 1989; Geider et al., 1997). Phytoplankton cells adjust their intracellular Chla inresponse to changes in light conditions through the process of photoacclimation (Dubinsky & Stambler,2009; Eisner et al., 2003; Falkowski & Laroche, 1991; Lindley et al., 1995). Photoacclimation-induced variations in intracellular Chla may cause large changes in the Chla-to-carbon ratio (Behrenfeld et al., 2005;Geider, 1987; Sathyendranath et al., 2009) and, thus, changes in the bbp-to-Chla ratio (Behrenfeld & Boss,2003; Siegel et al., 2005). In the upper oceanic layer of the water column, photoacclimation to high lightmay result in an increase in the bbp-to-Chla ratio whereas a decrease in this ratio occurs in DCM layers or inthe upper layer during winter time in subpolar regimes (NSPG and SO) where photoacclimation to low lightoccurs.The impact of light conditions on the bbp:Chla ratio in the different regimes is illustrated in Figure 7. Significant trends are observed in the different layers of the water column for all regimes except for the Black Sea.In the NSPG and SO regimes, the bbp:Chla ratio remains relatively constant with respect to the normalizedPAR regardless of the considered layer of the water column (Figures 7a–7c). In contrast, the MediterraneanSea and the subtropical gyres show a decoupling between bbp and Chla (Figures 5k–5w) so the bbp:Chlaratio in the productive, mixed or surface layer increases with an increase in the normalized PAR (Figures 7a–7c). The seasonal cycle of the bbp:Chla ratio in these regimes results from variations in Chla whereas bbpremains relatively constant over the seasons (not shown). Thus, our results suggest that the variability in thebbp:Chla ratio in the NSPG and SO regimes is not driven at first order by phytoplankton acclimation to lightlevel even if such a process is known to occur at shorter temporal and spatial scales in those regimes (Behrenfeld et al., 2015; Lutz et al., 2003). On the opposite, in both the MED and STG regimes the bbp:Chla ratiovariations are essentially driven by phytoplankton photoacclimation.In these oligotrophic regimes, Chla within the DCM layer is at least a factor of 2 higher than in the productive layer (Figure 6). In the lower part of the euphotic zone, phytoplankton cells hence adjust their intracellular Chla to low light conditions, resulting in a decrease in the bbp:Chla ratio. In addition, the bbp:Chla ratio inthis layer seems to remain constant within a regime regardless of absolute light conditions (Figure 7d).Actually, the absolute values of PAR essentially vary between 10 and 25 mmol quanta m22 s21 in all the bioregions along the year with values exceeding 50 mmol quanta m22 s21 only in the NW_MED and EQNASTZbioregions. As reported by Letelier et al. (2004) and Mignot et al. (2014), the DCM may follow a given isolume along the seasonal cycle and is thus essentially light driven. Finally, we suggest that the relative homogeneity of both the environmental (PAR) conditions and phytoplankton community composition at theDCM level in subtropical regimes may explain the relative stability of the bbp:Chla values in this water column layer. In the Mediterranean Sea, in contrast, some studies evoke changes in phytoplankton communities in the DCM layer (Crombet et al., 2011) suggesting our results might be further explored when relevantdata are available.Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans10.1002/2017JC013030=== [PAGE 15] ===4.4. Variability in the bbp-to-Chla Relationship Is Driven by a Combination of FactorsIn the previous sections, we examined the processes that potentially drive the variability in the bbp-to-Chlarelationship in the various oceanic regimes considered here.In the subpolar regimes NSPG and SO, changes in the composition of the particle assemblage, phytoplankton communities in particular, are likely the first-order driver of the seasonal variability in the bbp-to-Chlaratio (Figure 8). In these regimes, the bbp:Chla ratio remains constant regardless of the light intensity inboth the productive and surface layers suggesting that phytoplankton photoacclimation is likely not animportant driver of the variability in the bbp-to-Chla relationship. We note, however, that in the SO otherfactors may come into play, such as the light-mixing regime or iron limitation (e.g., Blain et al., 2007, 2013;Boyd, 2002). On the opposite, in the subtropical regime, Chla and bbp are decoupled in the surface layer aswell as in the DCM layer. Thus, photoacclimation seems to be the main process driving the vertical and seasonal variability of the bbp-to-Chla relationship, although a varying contribution of nonalgal particles to theparticle pool cannot be excluded.Whereas the subpolar and the subtropical regimes behave as a ‘‘biomass regime’’ and a ‘‘photoacclimationregime’’ (sensu Siegel et al., 2005), respectively, the Mediterranean Sea stands as an intermediate regimebetween these two end-members. The large number of data available in the Mediterranean allows us todescribe this intermediate situation (Figure 8). The Mediterranean Sea appears as a more complex and variable system than the stable and resilient subtropical gyres. Along with the ongoing development of theglobal BGC-Argo program and associated float deployments, additional data collected in underrepresentedregions will become available to make our database more robust and will help to improve our analysis. Inthe surface layer of the Mediterranean system, a high bbp:Chla ratio in summer might be attributed not onlyto (i) a background of submicronic living biological cells such as viruses and bacteria or large contributionof nonliving particles including detritus or inorganic particles (Bricaud et al., 2004; Claustre et al., 1999;Figure 7. Histogram of the monthly median bbp:Chla ratio as a function of the normalized Photosynthetically AvailableRadiation (PARnorm) for each regime within (a) the layer comprised between the surface and 1.5Zeu, (b) the mixed layer,(c) the surface layer, and (d) within the DCM layer. The color code indicates the regimes in which the BGC-Argo data werecollected. Note the different y scale for Figure 7d compared to Figures 7a–7c. The black lines on the top of each bar represent the standard deviation.Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans10.1002/2017JC013030=== [PAGE 16] ===Oubelkheir et al., 2005) or to (ii) photoacclimation of phytoplankton cells to high light conditions as suggested by Bellacicco et al. (2016), but also to (iii) a shift toward small phytoplankton dominated communities (picophytoplankton or nanophytoplankton) after the seasonal microphytoplankton bloom.Following the longitudinal trophic gradient of the Mediterranean Sea, we observe a variation in the biogeochemical status of the DCM (Figures 1a–d in Supporting information A). The DCM may be attributed to lowlight photoacclimation similarly to the DCM observed in the STG regime. Yet under favorable light andnutrient conditions encountered in the Western Mediterranean basin, the DCM could result from a real biomass increase occurring at depth instead of a simple photoacclimation ‘‘artifact’’ (Beckmann & Hense, 2007;Cullen, 2014; Mignot et al., 2014; Winn et al., 1995). In such conditions referred to as ‘‘deep biomass maximum’’ (DBM), a concurrent increase in Chla and POC associated with large phytoplankton cells leads to constantly low values of the bbp:Chla ratio (Figure 7d). Our results corroborate previous studies (Crombet et al.,2011; Latasa et al., 1992; Mignot et al., 2014) about the seasonal occurrence of a DBM in the Western Basinof Mediterranean Sea. This deep feature could actually represent a significant source of phytoplankton carbon biomass that is ignored by satellite ocean color sensors that only probe the surface layer of the watercolumn.Figure 8.

ConclusionsThe main goal of the present study was to examine the variability of the relationship between the particulate backscattering coefficient and the chlorophyll a concentration over a broad range of oceanic conditions. Using an extensive BGC-Argo profiling float database, we investigated the sources of variability in thisrelationship with respect to the vertical dimension as well as on a seasonal and regional scale. In accordancewith previous studies (Antoine et al., 2011; Dall’Olmo et al., 2009; Huot et al., 2008; Reynolds et al., 2001;Stramska et al., 2003; Xing et al., 2014) and consistently with the so-called ‘‘bio-optical assumption’’ (Siegelet al., 2005; Smith & Baker, 1978b), a general covariation between bbp and Chla is observed at a global scalein the productive layer of the water column (0–1.5Zeu). Although this covariation seems to be permanent insubpolar regimes in relation with large-amplitude phytoplankton biomass seasonal cycles (Boss & Behrenfeld, 2010; Henson et al., 2006; Lacour et al., 2015), several nuances have been revealed according to theseason, considered layer of the water column and bioregion. We suggest that the bbp:Chla ratio, proxy ofthe C:Chla ratio (Behrenfeld et al., 2015; Westberry et al., 2016), can be used either as an index of the nature(composition and size) of the particle assemblage in a ‘‘biomass regime’’ (NSPG and SO regimes and Western Mediterranean basin) or as a photophysiological index in a ‘‘photoacclimation regime’’ (STG regime andEastern Mediterranean basin).The present analysis provides insights into the coupling between major proxies of the POC and phytoplankton biomass in key regimes encountered in the world’s open oceans. It points to the strong potential of therecently available global BGC-Argo float database to address regional or seasonal nuances in first-order relationships that have been established in the past on admittedly restricted data sets. In addition, this studystresses out the large variability in the bbp-to-Chla relationship, which is critical to the bio-optical modelingof the bbp coefficient in several semiempirical ocean color models (Garver & Siegel, 1997; Lee et al., 2002;Maritorena et al., 2002). Indeed, bio-optical and reflectance models require detailed knowledge and parameterization of the average trends in the inherent optical properties, especially in open ocean waters wherethese trends can be related to Chla. Although the analysis of the impact of such variability on ocean colormodeling is out of the scope of the present paper, we expect our analysis to be potentially useful in thecontext of applications to ocean color. Finally, as the amount of BGC-float data will continue to increase, itwill be possible to reassess the variability of bio-optical relationships and to establish new ‘‘global’’ standards and regional parameterizations.ReferencesAhn, Y.-H., Bricaud, A., & Morel, A.
